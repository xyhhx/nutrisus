# Nutrisus

![Github Build](https://github.com/xyhhx/nutrisus/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

An app for perusing the [USDA Food Data Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/) database. The goal is to provide a pleasant, minimal viewer for that database. There's no registration, no tracking, and most of the app should work without Javascript.
